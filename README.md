# startup

First modification in the readme file, from the terminal on my computer. It is interesting to me that this will all be shared across so many different
platforms.

This is now the modification from the github website. I was previously unaware that this was possible, editing outside Now lets see what happens in the case of a conflict in the commit from github and now the commit from the console. This is the resolution.

# Really big heading
## Middle sized heading
### Gradually decreases heading size  
##### Smallest size heading

**This is used to bold text**  
*italics*  
~~strikethrough~~  
**Bold and _nested_ text**  
***All bold and italics***  
<sub> whatever this thing does  
  seems intereting</sub>  
<sup> This is superscript  
  compared to subscript</sup>  
    
  >Quoted text  

I learned a *lot* about formatting here on github and things I never knew befgore about how to resolve conflicts in code.  
I've never run into that problem before personally, but it was definitely instructive because I definitely can see it happening in the future.
